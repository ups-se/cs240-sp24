            <strong>Maddy Stephens</strong> is a first year CS student at the University of Puget Sound. Contrary
            to the implication of the photo, Maddy is a person and not a cat. Maddy does not have photos of herself.
            (this is genuine, I do not have a photo of myself; this is the best I can do ._.) She was born in Slovenia, 
            which always seems to make people pretend they're interested in hearing this information. :)

            Maddy would like you to look at this cool photo:
